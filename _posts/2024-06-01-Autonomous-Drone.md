Brief Overview 

This section of the website outlines the Autonomous Drone Competition Project sponsored by Raytheon that was part of my Senior Capstone Project at UCSB. As a general overview, this project was directed
as a competition between three schools. UCSB competed with Cal Poly Pomona and Cal State Long Beach at the SBCC football field and we ended up winning. The competition consisted of each team building an Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV)
and Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV), both being autonomus. The UAV and UGV can be described as Seeker and Evader respective in a sort of "cat and mouse" chase. There are four challenges, whereby the UGV moves in different 
behaviors (stationary, different velocities). To win the competition, each school's team is able to collect points. In each of the challenges, the home team's UAV needs to find the (opposing team's) UGV and deliver a water blast. Each 
team's UGV has an ArUco Marker used to identify its home team. To further clarify, there are different rounds (one for each school and each challenge) whereby each team has their UAV flying (but each team's UGV is always stationed on the field). The alloted budget for the development of this project was ~$5000.
