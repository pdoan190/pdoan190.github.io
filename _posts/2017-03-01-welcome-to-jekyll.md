title: "Blender CAD Project"
layout: post
---

The primarily focus of this project is to gain analytical insight into the manufacturing process by reverse engineering the given product (blender) and considering the various strategic choices that the manufacturer decided on in the implementation of the product. The project timeline is as follows: 1) Order a blender from Amazon ~$20 2) Disassemble the blender to its general fundamental parts ~ 19 parts. 3) Classify each of the parts through their predictive manufacturing processes and materials. 4) Use SolidWorks to CAD model each of the classified parts (with their measurements) to ultimately 3D model the blender and gain intuition of its geometric dimensioning and tolerancing 5) Draw up a representation of the product as an assembly diagram and identify key characteristics that enable functionality of the product. 6) Identify fits betweens holes and shafts based on model precision. 




You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.


To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
