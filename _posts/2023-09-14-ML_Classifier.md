This project aims on exploring the classifier archetype of a neural network by implemnting various statistical and linear algebra approaches. Using the publically available Iris data set, the algorithm learns the type of classification of the data set based on the length, width, petal length, and petal width. In doing so the model is trained and adjusts its weights accordingly
